# ✨ Project Summary: Comprehensive ML + LLM Pipeline

This project delivers an end-to-end automated pipeline for both traditional Machine Learning (ML) and modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) systems. It serves as a practical demonstration of MLOps best practices, leveraging a robust suite of open-source tools for orchestration, data processing, model management, and deployment.

## 💡 Project Highlights

### Part A: ML Pipeline (Wine Quality Prediction) 🍷

* **Automated ML Lifecycle:** A complete ML pipeline, from raw data to a production-ready API, is fully automated via Airflow DAGs.
* **Scalable Data Handling:** Leverages PySpark for efficient and distributed data preprocessing, suitable for large datasets.
* **Reproducible ML:** MLflow ensures all experiments, models, and artifacts are meticulously tracked, enabling easy reproducibility and version control.
* **Production-Ready Deployment:** The latest production model is automatically deployed and served through a FastAPI microservice, ready for seamless integration.

### Part B: RAG-style LLM Pipeline 🧠

* **Context-Aware AI:** Successfully implemented a RAG system that augments a small LLM (`google/flan-t5-small`) with retrieved information from custom documents, enabling more accurate and grounded answers.
* **Efficient Information Retrieval:** Utilizes `sentence-transformers` for high-quality embeddings and FAISS for lightning-fast similarity searches across document chunks.
* **Modular & Portable:** The RAG component is designed as a self-contained microservice, deployed independently via its own Docker setup, showcasing a robust modular architecture.
* **User-Friendly API:** Provides a straightforward FastAPI endpoint for querying the RAG system, making it easy to integrate into other applications.

## ⚙️ Development Setup & Considerations

* **Local Development:** The setup uses lightweight SQLite for Airflow and Docker volumes for persistent storage of logs, model files, and the FAISS index, facilitating easy local development and quick iteration.
* **Production Scalability:** For production environments, the setup is designed to be easily upgraded by replacing SQLite with PostgreSQL and adopting a CeleryExecutor for Airflow, enabling distributed task execution.
* **Containerization Strategy:** Docker Compose orchestrates all services, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment across different machines. The RAG component's self-contained Docker setup within its subdirectory exemplifies best practices for microservice deployment.
