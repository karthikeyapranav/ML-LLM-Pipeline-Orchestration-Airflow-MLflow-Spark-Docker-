‚ú® Project Summary: Comprehensive ML + LLM Pipeline
This project delivers an end-to-end automated pipeline for both traditional Machine Learning (ML) and modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) systems. It serves as a practical demonstration of MLOps best practices, leveraging a suite of open-source tools for orchestration, data processing, model management, and deployment.

üß© Key Components & Their Roles
Component

Purpose

Apache Airflow

Orchestrates and automates the ML training and deployment pipeline.

Apache PySpark

Enables scalable data transformation and processing for ML.

MLflow

Provides robust model tracking, versioning, and a model registry.

FastAPI

Serves high-performance REST APIs for both ML predictions and RAG Q&A.

FAISS

Acts as an efficient vector database for semantic search in RAG.

LLMs & Embeddings

Powers the RAG system with contextualized text generation.

Docker

Ensures consistent, isolated, and portable environments for all services.

üí° Project Highlights
Part A: ML Pipeline (Wine Quality Prediction)
Automated ML Lifecycle: A complete ML pipeline, from raw data to a production-ready API, is fully automated via Airflow DAGs.

Scalable Data Handling: Leverages PySpark for efficient and distributed data preprocessing, suitable for large datasets.

Reproducible ML: MLflow ensures all experiments, models, and artifacts are tracked, enabling easy reproducibility and version control.

Production-Ready Deployment: The latest production model is automatically deployed and served through a FastAPI microservice, ready for integration.

Part B: RAG-style LLM Pipeline
Context-Aware AI: Successfully implemented a RAG system that augments a small LLM (google/flan-t5-small) with retrieved information from custom documents, enabling more accurate and grounded answers.

Efficient Information Retrieval: Utilizes sentence-transformers for high-quality embeddings and FAISS for lightning-fast similarity searches across document chunks.

Modular & Portable: The RAG component is designed as a self-contained microservice, deployed independently via its own Docker setup, showcasing modular architecture.

User-Friendly API: Provides a straightforward FastAPI endpoint for querying the RAG system, making it easy to integrate into other applications.

‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup & Considerations
Local Development: The setup uses lightweight SQLite for Airflow and Docker volumes for persistent storage of logs, model files, and the FAISS index, facilitating easy local development.

Production Scalability: For production environments, the setup is designed to be easily upgraded by replacing SQLite with PostgreSQL and using a CeleryExecutor for Airflow.

Containerization Strategy: Docker Compose orchestrates all services, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment. The RAG component's self-contained Docker setup within its subdirectory exemplifies best practices for microservice deployment.
